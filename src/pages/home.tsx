                Diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given 30 days to live, Ron Woodroof wasn't the kind of man to go down without a fight. He smuggled unapproved, life-saving drugs into Texas and started the Dallas Buyers Club.

            <br />
            <p class="text-xl">
                This wasn't just about survival; it was a revolution. A middle finger to a system that had left them for dead. The club became a lifeline for hundreds of people, providing hope when there was none.
