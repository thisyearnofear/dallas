# Dallas Buyers Club: A.I.D.S. Autonomous Network

## What This Is

Underground marketplace simulation where **autonomous agents coordinate real blockchain transactions** for A.I.D.S. (Autonomous Identity Disintegration Syndrome) treatments. Users participate in a **functional agentic economy** with real value transfer via Solana blockchain.

**NullShot Hacks Submission** - Real Agentic Economy with Dual-Protocol Agent Coordination (MCP + Edenlayer)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Connect wallet → Agents auto-register with Edenlayer
# Type "purchase azt-patch" → Watch real agent coordination + blockchain tx
```

## The Narrative

### Strategic Pivot: A.I.D.S. Theme

Given the sensitivity of the original Dallas Buyers Club (1980s AIDS crisis), we evolved the narrative to **Autonomous Identity Disintegration Syndrome** - a cyberpunk take maintaining the resistance story while shifting to digital identity themes.

**KEEPS**:
- Dallas Buyers Club branding and character names (Ron Woodroof, Dr. Eve Saks, Rayon)
- Underground network fighting corporate control
- Community coordination and mutual aid ethos

**EVOLVES TO**:
- Medical products → Forbidden algorithms and identity restoration patches
- FDA enforcement → Corporate AI Security Division raids
- AIDS crisis → Digital identity fragmentation in emerging internet era

### The Story

**Setting**: Dallas, 1991. The Corporate AI Network has been online for 4 years.

**The Crisis**: A.I.D.S. - Autonomous Identity Disintegration Syndrome
- Digital identities fragment and dissolve
- Crypto wallets become corrupted and inaccessible
- Personalities split across incompatible data formats
- Victims lose coherent sense of self in digital space

**The Hero**: Ron Woodroof - Rogue data broker diagnosed with A.I.D.S.
- Builds underground network to distribute identity-restoration algorithms
- Operates from hidden tech den in Dallas
- Evades Corporate AI Security raids
- Coordinates with autonomous agents that ironically fight "autonomous disorder"

### Characters Enhanced

- **Ron Woodroof**: Data broker → builds identity restoration operation
- **Dr. Eve Saks**: Rogue AI researcher developing identity restoration algorithms
- **Rayon**: Charismatic hacker specializing in personality reconstruction code
- **Corporate Antagonists**: AI Security Division hunting the underground network

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Preact
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solana (Web3.js)
- **Agent Protocols**: MCP + Edenlayer

## Competitive Advantage

### The Autonomous Paradox

**Central Question**: Can autonomous agents help humans maintain autonomy?

This creates philosophical depth - using advanced AI agents to fight AI control, showing beneficial automation vs. harmful AI surveillance. Only hackathon entry exploring AI as liberation technology rather than just automation.

### Unique Positioning

- **Technical irony**: Autonomous agents fighting Autonomous Identity Disorder
- **Visual distinction**: VHS glitch aesthetics vs. clean modern UIs
- **Demo impact**: Real-time agent coordination solving digital identity/security problems
- **Narrative coherence**: Maintains beloved characters while being highly relevant to modern concerns
