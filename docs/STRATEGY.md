# Dallas Buyers Club: Strategy & Tokenomics

## Executive Summary
Dallas Buyers Club is building a **decentralized health research platform** where:
1. **Users share health experiences privately** (encrypted with wallet keys)
2. **Agents match experiences without exposing PII** (privacy tooling on Solana)
3. **Community validates with aligned incentives** (tokens reward accuracy, penalize fraud)
4. **Researchers get funded and own their protocols** (via tokenized IP rights)
5. **Platform generates sustainable revenue** (data licensing, markets, API access)

**Why now?** Solana Privacy Hackathon provides perfect funding/timeline. DeSci (decentralized science) is ready. Health sovereignty is trending. Tokenomics align incentives better than traditional platforms.

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: HACKATHON MVP (Jan 12 - Feb 1, 2026)
**Goal:** Win Privacy Hack + Prove Core Mechanics

**What we build:**
- Encrypted case study storage (Solana Anchor)
- Privacy agent matching (Arcium/Privacy Cash)
- Community validation framework
- Governance voting UI

**Why it wins:**
- Privacy is core, not bolted on
- Real utility (matches people to experiences privately)
- Solana-native (agents, wallet integration, on-chain governance)
- Open-source (forkable for other domains)

**Success = $15k-20k prize + credibility**

### Phase 2: TOKEN LAUNCH (Feb - May, 2026)
**Goal:** Build Sustainable Incentive Structure

**Three-token system:**

#### 1. EXPERIENCE (Governance + Accountability)
- Non-tradeable governance token
- Validators stake to review claims; lose tokens for fraud
- Vote on which protocols to feature
- Max supply: 1,000,000

**Earning:**
- Submit a case study → +1 EXPERIENCE
- Validate another's case study → +0.1 EXPERIENCE
- Find fraud → +10 EXPERIENCE
- Early airdrop → 10-100 EXPERIENCE

**Slashing mechanism:**
```
If you validate a fraudulent case study:
├─ Lose 50% of staked EXPERIENCE → burned
├─ DAO treasury gets 50% → used for bounties
└─ Whistleblower gets 10% bounty
```

#### 2. PROTOCOL (IP Ownership + Revenue)
- Created when a protocol gets 5+ validated case studies
- Tradeable after 6+ months of proven track record
- Generates revenue from data licensing, API access, research grants

**Distribution:**
- 40% → Original case study author(s)
- 30% → Validators who confirmed it works
- 20% → Protocol development fund
- 10% → DAO Treasury

#### 3. OUTCOME (Prediction Markets + Accountability)
- On-demand tokens for prediction markets
- Users stake SOL on health outcomes; loser's tokens burn
- Markets settle when validators verify outcomes

**Safety guardrails:**
- Market size cap: 100 SOL initially
- 3 independent validators required for settlement
- 7-day dispute period

**Success = 500 case studies, 50+ protocols, $5k-10k/month revenue**

### Phase 3: DESCI INTEGRATION (Apr - Aug, 2026)
**Goal:** Become Part of DeSci Ecosystem

**Key moves:**

1. **BIO.xyz Launchpad Integration**
   - Submit as "Health Sovereignty DAO"
   - Access to 50k+ DeSci audience
   - Establishes legitimacy in research community

2. **Revenue Flywheel**
   - Pharma companies license anonymized health outcomes
   - Prediction markets generate trading volume (5% cut)
   - API access for researchers
   - Total: $20k+/month by August

3. **Researcher Partnerships**
   - VitaDAO co-funding protocols
   - Direct protocol funding (milestone-based)
   - IP ownership clarity

**Success = $20k/month revenue, researcher partnerships, DAO governance**

## Tokenomics Summary

| Token | Supply | Purpose | Tradeable? | Risk |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|------|
| **EXPERIENCE** | 1M | Governance + Validation | No (initially) | Slashing for false validation |
| **PROTOCOL-X** | Variable | IP rights + revenue share | Yes (after utility proven) | Dilution if protocol quality drops |
| **OUTCOME** | Dynamic | Prediction markets | Yes (burn on loss) | Speculative; must be gated |

## Why Tokens Drive the Right Behavior

### Without Tokens
- Users share vague claims
- No incentive for accuracy
- Bad data mixed with good data
- No funding for validation or research
- Platform becomes unvetted forum

### With Tokens
- Validators have skin in the game
- Researchers get compensated
- Community funds what matters
- Data quality improves
- Platform becomes sustainable

### Token Safeguards
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Users lie for tokens | Validators lose tokens for approving false claims |
| Validators collude | Requires 3 independent validators |
| Pump-and-dump | PROTOCOL tokens created after validation |
| Outcome fraud | Results verified by 3 validators |
| Governance bought | EXPERIENCE non-tradeable |

## 6-Month Timeline

```
WEEK 1: Privacy infrastructure (Anchor, encryption)
WEEK 2: Agent matching (Arcium/Privacy Cash integration)
WEEK 3: Validation + governance (voting UI, validator slashing)
WEEK 4: Polish + submit Privacy Hack

[HACKATHON ENDS - Feb 1]

MONTH 2: Launch EXPERIENCE token, gather 100 case studies
MONTH 3: Apply to BIO.xyz, first PROTOCOL tokens mint, partnerships
MONTH 4: Revenue streams activate (data licensing, API)
MONTH 5: PROTOCOL tokens tradeable, 50+ protocols validated
MONTH 6: Full DAO governance, $20k/month revenue, sustainable
```

## Success Metrics

### Hackathon (Feb 1)
- Live Privacy Hack submission
- 10-20 example case studies on-chain
- Agent matching working (privacy preserved)
- Validation UI functional
- Open-source code + full documentation

### Post-Hackathon (May 31)
- 500 case studies
- 50+ protocols with PROTOCOL tokens
- 200+ active validators holding EXPERIENCE

- $20k+/month revenue
- Sustainable DAO governance
- Full token liquidity (Jupiter listing)
- Multiple revenue streams active

## Competitive Landscape

### vs. Centralized Health Platforms (MyFitnessPal, Apple Health)
- **We win on:** Privacy (user owns keys), decentralization (user-governed)

### vs. Research Platforms (ResearchHub, Gitcoin)
- **We win on:** Health focus, outcome verification, tokenized incentives

### vs. Other DeSci (VitaDAO, Cure DAO)
- **We win on:** User-generated data (N=1 trials), privacy-first, health outcomes

### vs. Traditional Trials
- **We win on:** Speed (days vs. months), cost (10x cheaper), access (global)

## The Vision
This is not just a health platform. This is infrastructure for **health autonomy at scale.**

In 2026, the barriers to health information are no longer legal—they're informational. We're building the network where people can **legally access, verify, and fund the health information they need** without asking permission from centralized institutions.

The product is verified health outcome data.  
The platform is decentralized.  
The incentives are tokenized (accuracy rewarded, fraud penalized).  
The governance is democratic.  
The future is community-owned.

That's Dallas Buyers Club 2.0.
