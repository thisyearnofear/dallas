**Duration**: 3 minutes maximum  
**Track**: Open Track (Pool Prize - $18,000)  
**Target Sponsors**: Light Protocol, Aztec/Noir, Arcium, Helius, Quicknode

## Script

### **Opening (15 seconds)**

*[Screen: DBC Logo Animation → Platform Homepage]*

**Narrator**: "Imagine sharing your most sensitive health data—knowing it's 100% private, yet still contributing to research that could save lives."

**Text Overlay**: "Dallas Buyers Club: Privacy-Preserving Health Communities"

---

### **The Problem (20 seconds)**

*[Screen: Split view - Forum screenshot vs. Empty database icons]*

**Narrator**: "Patients with rare diseases are isolated. Their treatment experiences are trapped in forums, lost forever. And when they do share? Their privacy is compromised."

*[Screen: Privacy breach headlines fade in/out]*

**Narrator**: "Centralized platforms monetize your data. Researchers wait 10-15 years for insights. And patients stay alone."

---

### **Our Solution: Three Privacy Primitives (90 seconds)**

*[Section transitions with tech stack visualization]*

---

#### **1. Light Protocol: ZK Compression (30 seconds)**

*[Screen: Demo of EncryptedCaseStudyForm.tsx → Compression UI]*

**Narrator**: "Meet Sarah. She wants to share her treatment journey for Long COVID. But detailed health data is massive—and expensive to store on-chain."

*[Screen: Compression selector dropdown with ratios: 2x, 5x, 10x, 20x, 50x]*

**Narrator**: "Using Light Protocol, Sarah's case study is compressed 90%—from 5KB to 500 bytes. She saves 90% on storage costs."

*[Screen: Real-time preview showing "5.2 KB → 520 B (90% saved)"]*

**Narrator**: "ZK compression makes detailed health histories affordable for everyone."

**Code Peek**:
```typescript
// src/services/privacy/LightProtocolService.ts
const compressed = await lightProtocol.compressCaseStudy(
  data, 
  { ratio: 10 } // 10x compression
);
```

---

#### **2. Noir (Aztec): Zero-Knowledge Validation (30 seconds)**

*[Screen: Demo of ValidationDashboard.tsx → Expert Mode toggle]*

**Narrator**: "Now meet Dr. Chen, a validator. She needs to verify Sarah's case study—without seeing Sarah's actual health data."

*[Screen: Toggle "Expert Mode ON" → ZK proof generation animation]*

**Narrator**: "Using Noir circuits, we generate ZK proofs that prove validity without revealing sensitive information."

**Visual**: Four circuit icons with checkmarks
- ✅ Symptom Improvement
- ✅ Duration Verification
- ✅ Data Completeness
- ✅ Cost Range

**Narrator**: "Dr. Chen validates that Sarah's symptoms improved by at least 20%—without knowing the actual scores. She verifies treatment duration was 30 days—without seeing the dates."

*[Screen: Terminal showing `nargo test` with all 26 tests passing]*

**Narrator**: "Four circuits. Twenty-six tests. All passing. Zero data exposure."

**Code Peek**:
```rust
// circuits/symptom_improvement/src/main.nr
fn main(
    baseline_severity: u8,      // Private - never revealed
    outcome_severity: u8,       // Private - never revealed
    min_improvement: u8,        // Public threshold
) -> pub bool {
    let improvement = baseline_severity - outcome_severity;
    improvement >= (baseline_severity * min_improvement) / 100
}
```

---

#### **3. Arcium MPC: Threshold Decryption (30 seconds)**

*[Screen: ResearcherDashboard.tsx → Access request form]*

**Narrator**: "Finally, meet Dr. Patel, a researcher studying Long COVID patterns. She needs aggregate data—but Sarah's privacy must be preserved."

*[Screen: Committee formation animation - 5 validators selected]*

**Narrator**: "Using Arcium MPC, we form a committee of five validators. Dr. Patel needs three approvals to decrypt."

*[Screen: Approval progress bar filling up - 1/5, 2/5, 3/5 approvals]*

**Narrator**: "No single validator can access the data. No central authority holds the keys. Only when three of five approve does decryption occur."

*[Screen: Researcher viewing aggregated insights, individual data never shown]*

**Narrator**: "Research progresses. Privacy remains intact. Trust is distributed."

**Code Peek**:
```typescript
// src/services/privacy/ArciumMPCService.ts
const decryption = await arcium.decryptData(
  sessionId,
  requester,
  { threshold: 3, committee: 5 }
);
```

### **Community Tokenization (30 seconds)**

*[Screen: Community creation flow with Bags API integration]*

**Narrator**: "But DBC isn't just about privacy—it's about community."

*[Screen: Interactive token creation form at /experiences]*

**Narrator**: "Anyone can launch a health community in minutes. Choose your category—supplement, lifestyle, device, or protocol."

**Visual**: Community tokens appearing on screen
- LupusDAO ($LUPUS)
- LongevityCoin ($LONG)
- MindfulToken ($MIND)
- [Your Community Here]

**Narrator**: "Built on Bags API bonding curves—free to launch, self-funding through trading volume. The creator earns 1% forever. Communities own their destiny."

---

### **Architecture & Implementation (20 seconds)**

*[Screen: System architecture diagram with privacy layer highlighted]*

**Narrator**: "Our privacy stack is modular, domain-driven, and production-ready."

**Visual**: Three implemented services
```
src/services/privacy/
├── NoirService.ts           ✅ 4 circuits, 26 tests
├── LightProtocolService.ts  ✅ 2x-50x compression
└── ArciumMPCService.ts      ✅ K-of-N threshold
```

**Narrator**: "Built on Solana Devnet. Anchor framework for type-safe contracts. Preact + TypeScript for fast UI. IPFS + Arweave for encrypted storage."

*[Screen: Test results - all green]*

**Narrator**: "Every component tested. Every integration verified. Open source and ready."

---

### **Closing (15 seconds)**

*[Screen: Back to Sarah, Dr. Chen, Dr. Patel—three smiling people in different locations]*

**Narrator**: "Dallas Buyers Club: Where privacy meets progress. Where patients own their data. Where communities thrive."

**Text Overlay**: "DBC: The Coordination Layer for Health Communities"

*[Screen: GitHub link + Demo URL]*

**Narrator**: "Open source. Privacy-first. Community-owned. Join us."
